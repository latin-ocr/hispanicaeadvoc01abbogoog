CHAPTER IX
W hether W e May Lawfully Put to Death Those W ho Set Out to

Serve with Our Enemies

It is maintained that all those who set out to serve with the
enemy may lawfully be seized and put to death as enemies by the
Dutch, for they are on the point of serving with the enemy, and the
situation is the same as if they were serving at the present moment,
⁸ since the cases of being a thing now and of planning to be in the
immediate future are parallel. [To put it in other wordS,] potentiality
which approaches actuality is thought of as actuality, etc. Now there
is no doubt that it is lawful to put to death all who are actually
serving. And here Ι beg you to observe that the inquiry concerns
those who have also given their names in to the enemy3 who have
received money as pay from the enemy, and therefore the Journey
they are making is undoubtedly made to join the enemy. Conse-
quently, another argument follows, ¹³ drawn from the rule that one
should consider the beginning when the end necessarily follows the

38 beginning. In the third place, the statement which is made about a
soldier, that ‘- when ordered to equip himself at once, he is regarded
as equipped is really an axiom. ‘¹ F ourthly, the ruling of Castrensis

others, and Jason‚ too, follows it: that as an enemy who is proscribed
may be killed without prejudice‚ so, too, may one be killed who is
going to be proscribed in the immediate future. In the fifth place,
they say that the Romans made this decision against the people of
Lanuvium in a case which was less convincing. ‘When the people
of Lanuvium set out to give aid to the Latins against the
Romans, and when the first ranks had Just passed out of the gates
and the people heard that the Latins were already defeated and the
troops had, therefore, turned back into the city, notwithstanding
these facts, they were told by their praetor that “for this bit of a
march they would have to pay a high price to the Romans.” ² In the
sixth place, the facts which we once collected in support of a justifiable
defense are cited, Ι mean the fact that we lawfully use force against
him who is making ready to use force against us, etc. Seventhly,
the point is made that the Dutch would have raised an outcry to no
purpose after these Britons of ours had come to the Spanish camp.
