CHAPTER X

Of Marks, the Letters of M erchants, and Other Documents from
the Collectors of Revenue',· and of Proof of Owner-
ship and Possession

Brands, ³ they call them marks (marchae), stamped on bundles
and on chests of merchandise do not furnish full proof of the owner·
ship of the merchandise3 they furnish a presumptive and unreliable
proof‚ as Straccha well puts it, and on this point Menochius and the
others teach the same doctrine. But even before Straccha others
have taught this, so that undoubtedly this is the common view.
”⁴⁶ The letters of merchants in accordance with usage are said to
have the force of public recordS, and are accepted by everybody.”
‘² This is true, too, of the documents from the collectors of revenue‚
‘¹but these letters, to be used as proof‚ must be acknowledged.
However, it is an accepted principle that letters not acknowledged are
certified by a comparison [sc. with other letters where the writer is
knownJ, and the same practice would hold for account-books.
⁰ In the case of receipts the principle would not be the same, unless
the said receipt, which has not been acknowledged, has the signature
of three witnesses3 with another receipt it is not possible to secure
a comparison. And the reason for the difference is that the party
interested in the case of a receipt ought to take the consequences upon
himself 'if the business was not carried out in due form. On these
points Straccha holds the same opinion, and concerning the comparison
of the letters he also mentions something else to the same effect,
which I do not set down. ‘Other writers too remark in the same
way on the difficulty of proving a private document, even a docu-
ment between merchants. All these points I note against the Dutch
in this case, who wish to offer a full and immediate proof of their
ownership and of their possession by those processes which are unre-

163 liable and call for a somewhat careful investigation. Here I cried
out in a manner not mine, but that of pettifoggers.

⁸ It is more difficult to acquire possession than ownership, and
¹² ownership, even of personal property, as Purpuratus sayS, is very
difficult to prove, and, ias Purpuratus and others remark, almost
impossible. ltVarious things are needed for the proof‚ namely, of

ownership. ¹That the transfer has taken place must especially be

established, even to the extent of a transfer of possession, ¹¹² and al-
