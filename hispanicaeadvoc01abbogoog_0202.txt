The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 177

some supporting circumstance, ”⁸²¹² for instance, fraud and deception, is
combined with silence, it even the trial (we mean this trial now) is a
heated one ton. In judicial proceedings the party who keeps silent
is always regarded as the consentingparty, and this case expounders
of the law everywhere accept, and this is what Menochius teaches.
000 Thus others in the case of an extension say, and even Vasquius
himself says„ that it would be more commonly accepted and safer.
Now, it would not stand in the way of these arguments that
Menochius also teaches that they do not hold in the case of one who
is absent, nor even in the case of one who is present, if he is ignorant
of what is going on—these two points I hear whispered about by
our adversaries—³⁹⁹ for we have shown that they all knew, and we 175
have said that some of them were present, and it is undoubtedly true.

Besides this doctrine of Menochius seems to hold for matters out·
side the court, since nothing is said of presence in l. saepe,² and
Ruinus, cited by MenochiuS, is talking of extrajudicial matters, and
if this were not. so then there would be no special provision in the
case of judicial matters. F inally in our case we ought to remember
that the mere inconvenience of the owners is not at issue, when the
defense of their property is undertaken, and in the case of the navi-
gator the dictum of Menochius would not hold, for what has been

handed over to the navigator under the mandate belongs in this case
altogether to the absent owners. Indeed‚ several other replies can
be made to the sameeffect.
