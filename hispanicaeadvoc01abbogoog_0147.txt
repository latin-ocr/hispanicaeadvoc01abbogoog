CHAPTER XXVII

Of an Enqlish Ship Which {ouqht zgith a Tuscan ship and W as
aptare

The English ship was captured in battle by a Tuscan ship and
confiscated. Now the judges in Florence say that the explanation
of the verdict is that our vessel went to attack the other, while the
other did simply what was necessary for defense.

Pardon me, your honorS, if I reply that there seems to be
neither any probability in the premises on which the verdict is based
nor any truth in the conclusion. ⁸ You must admit that he is presumed
to be ‘⁶ the aggressor ’⁹ who thought that he had suffered some wrong.
Even mere opinion would suffice here where the intent is in ques·
tion. Now, the Tuscan might have thought that he was being
wronged by the commerce of the English with the TurkS. He is
presumed to be “the aggressor ” who is under arms and waiting.
Now the Tuscan was the person who, as it appears from what was
done with other ships of ourS, was awaiting just such merchant ves-
sels of ours. ¹³ ‘⁴ He is presumed to be the aggressor ” who is stronger
than his opponent. And who does not see that the Tuscan ship was
stronger than our merchant vessel? ‘² He is presumed to be “ the ag-
gressor” who is accustomed to brawl and who carries weapons.
Is the soldier such an one or the merchant? In fine, that person is
presumed to be “the aggressor ” wh0, besides fitting the hypotheses

120 just mentioned, is the victor. Who is such an one? What are we
seeking? Even the verdict recites that the Tuscan vessel fired two
broadsides first; and so might not the Tuscan vessel be responsible
for the engagement? ‘¹ He who gave the challenge to battle and to
wrath is held to have begun it, and the prince from whom the malice
originated is adjudged to be in fault, and, therefore, everything
which may have followed is imputed to him as the aggressor.

Why, your honors, would my opponents say that it is the custom
and sign manual of friendship to discharge a broadside once and yet
again? ² It is the custom of a warship which is challenging a vessel‚
and it does so to assert its authority. This treatment the Tuscan ships
were meting out to other vessels also at that time. Therefore‚ the
defense of the English was taken against interference and threats.
“The Tuscans wished to examine our ship, as is patent from their
treatment of others. Therefore, they were coming to interfere with

the voyage of our people and to intercept their trade, as is patent
