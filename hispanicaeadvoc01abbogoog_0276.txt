A LETTER To A FELLow-ADVOCATE

The matter has been finished, it is true, as we wished, but the
judge was right in replying that those arguments which you offered
on the impropriety of appealing in a case of temporary possession are
general and subject to many limitations. In my response Ι noted
the fact that the case at issue was not of a possessory character, but
involved an incidental point conceming the acceptance of bondsmen-
⁸ In such an incidental inquiry, and in all otherS, an appeal is granted,
although one is not granted in the case of an action for possession.
Thus your arguments were outside the present inquiry. Most learned
man, always remember to notice the form which the question takes,
although you both may include, and perhaps also at times ought to

include, what either may not be pertinent to the matter, or may be
of no weight. bBy such things some judges are often more influ-

enced than they are by appropriate and sound considerations. Accept
this hint from me.

On my side 1 shall gladly hear from you if I have committed
any faults. You shall hear the faults which the other side has
committed. Ι have told the story to the ambassador in a letter.
Here I add to you one point, which concerns your aforementioned
allegations‚ that the other party did not appeal from the decision
of those who valued the merchandise in controversy. cYet they
could have appealed from this verdict, although they could not have
appealed from a verdict in a case of temporary possession. ‘¹ They
could maintain that it was lawful for them to appeal again within 252
ten days from the interlocutory decree establishing bondsmen, and
could allege new reasons for appealing. Good heavensl what
mistakes have been made by our adversarieS, or what mistakes are
being made by me in this estimate of their errorsl Other mistakes
of the parties concerned in the action itself for possession I neither
mention to you, whom they concerned at that time, nor do I com-
municate thern to otherS, lest it may injure us in other cases. Now,

if you continue asking, I shall tell you that the party concerned could
