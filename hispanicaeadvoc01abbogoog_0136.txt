The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. “ 11 1

a doubtful case ’⁹ one should say that permission would be more
beneficent than prohibition, etc. Nowhere, moreover,—-show the con·
trary, if you can—do we read the words “ expressly forbidden ’⁹ in
connection with the buying from anyone things forcibly taken by
pirates from a foreign party. This is our case. These merchants
bought wares forcibly taken from a Venetian by a foreign pirate and
from the foreign purchasers of those wares in a foreign place. Either
show that this clear statement is false or stand by the rule. 'The
matter is definitely in favor of him who has the rule on his side.

Do you wish some reasoning also to show why the special en-
actment with reference to stolen property does not hold in the case
of goods seized by violence? 2The enactrnent is special on account
of the frequency of thefts, says Corneus. ⁸³1 shall add from Alciatus
that a pirate commits a less serious crime if he commits it on the high
seas which are under no law. bb For this reason the Venetians are
independent by the sheer force of law, because their state is founded
in the sea. For this reason this same Alciatus approves the cele-
brated reply of the pirate to Alexander3 ⁰⁰ in this way we answer the
query why Menochius says that the principles of the law incivilem,
Code, De furtis,² do not apply to wares seized by violence. Accord-
ingly, the argument is as follows: Under the rule even wares seized
by pirates belong to unrestricted commerce3 but these wares are
such3 therefore, etc. Now, the major proposition has been established
firmly. ‘¹⁶ Then, too, it would be established by HotomannuS, who
“ On Famous Cases ’⁹ writes that arrangements with pirates are re· 110
garded as permissible because no law prohibits them3 and Alciatus
himself so thought and writes that the pirate should be deprived of no
right of which he is not expressly deprived by law. But the secOnd
proposition is one which our opponents urge and which we neverthe-
less will deny most earnestly. From this we shall make our fourth
argument: A thing purchased which does not corne from plunder,
shall be retained by the purchaser, as is certain and indubitable3 but
what the Venetian is now secking does not come from plunder3 there-
fore, it shall be retained by the purchaser. The Venetian has to prove
the minor premise false. It is he that has to prove the identity of the
things. ‘⁶ Identity has to be proven by him who bases his argument
thereon. ‘² Further‚ it has to be reconstructed. Otherwise the Venetian
will fail to save himself, as Corneus says on this proposition. ⁸⁸ Then,
τοο, the identity has to be proved by two concurrent demonstratione.
in addition to the identity of nameS. ¹³¹¹ Now the proof is difficult
here, where it is a question of things, which on account of their
great similarity to other things of the same species, are difficult to
recognize. Further‚ the recognition of uniform things, such as fruita
