as a rule are not wont to be carried out without the help of con·
federateS. This likewise is the common opinion and the one observed
in practice, and this opinion also applies to our case, which is a
piratical case where confederates are concerned. Moreover, prac-
tice (Clarus too teaches this) applies this principle likewise in the
case of all crimes, at least in the case of theft and robbery. This
can be the fifth rule in the case of our witnesses, or rather the
sixth.

¹The seventh is that they would be accepted in civil actions, and
now civil action is brought, since merely the restoration of property
is aimed at. ”Thus action can be taken, even though the crime

„would be a public one.

¹²The eighth point in our defense is that they are not accepted
as entirely competent witnesses, and they are believed only when they
say what is probable. But that probable testimony is given by these
witnesses is evident from the fact that they are testifying against
themselves, ⁰ and one cannot believe that a person deposes to his own
disadvantage, unless it is the truth that he is telling. It is clear that
the testimony is probable from the fact that the opposite would be
very improbable: that a single Dutchman, a stranger, of humble birth,
a poor man, acted as leader for all the rest, who were Englishrnen, as
master of the whole expedition.

The ninth reply is that in this case the question turns not so
much on the evidence as on the confessions of criminals. It would
indeed be a thing unheard of not to believe the confessions of guilty
men of this sort. ¹'Anybody can testify against himself. “In fact,
we believe more the confession of a principal than we do a thousand
witnesses who assert the opposite.

τ The tenth reply is that witnesses are accepted as suitable if they
are supported either by other suitable witnesses or by inferences, and
here there are other inferences which have been mentioned above,
inferences based on the incredible leadership and mastery held by a
Dutchman, on the credible leadership and mastery held by Eng-
lishmen. The privateer was bought in England; here it was fitted
out also with everything3 from here it also sailed out with all the
English confederates. Would not a Dutch master have procured
everything in Holland? The English, accustomed for a very long
time during the last war to plundering expeditions of this sort, but
now being forbidden them, still cannot desist, and have thought
of these devices for covering up their deceit; they have chosen a
person to call leader and master. But all this is a thin disguise, ⁸ and
deceit is proved here by the unusual nature of the circumstances,
even by easily made inferences. What is not “naturally wont” to
take place should not be believed. Now, is this ‘⁴ a thing naturally
