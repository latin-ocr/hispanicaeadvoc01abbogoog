The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 145

on the strength of the fleeting word of his disclosure. Besides, a
witness may have forgotten what he has said.

¹²1 mention Baldus, τοο, who is more explicit. He writes. that
evidence which a party has been allowed by a notary to see does not
lose its force. Consequently, much less would it lose its force owing

to disclosures by a witness, οΙ am surprised that Decianus, in the,

case of evidence which has been read, says that much of its credibility
is lost. He makes the statement, but offers no proof of it. ¹’That
the notary would be punished‚ as well as the witness, is quite true,
as Decianus and others remark. But that is another question.
‘¹The notary who discloses the testimony of witnesses before it has
been made public is *held for betrayal of trust3 thus, one was con-
victed at Padua on my advice and the advice of other doctors,
says Jacobus de Belvis0. He makes the same remark in the case
of an advocate or an agent who discloses documents and other secret
matters3 in the case of a judge who discloses his verdict before an·
nouncing it.

* The testimony of witnesses is not invalidated, even if the parties
have been present at the examination, although (and this too is an-
other matter) the parties in this case would not be able to introduce
new witnesses concerning the same points, or concerning directly
opposite points, because they have learned the testimony.

It is one question whether the word prodiderunt in the aforemen-
tioned law indicates a disclosure‚ as Cervottus and several others have
claimed3 and another, whether the credibility of the witnesses

who make a disclosure is lessened, as no writers except Fulgosius ,

and Albericus assert. The law mentioned above talks of punishing
such witnesses, not of invalidating their evidence. Also, it is one
question which arises in the case of witnesses revealing what they
have said, and another question in the case of those who state in ad-
vance what they are going to say. The latter is the question before
us, and in it we have no one arguing on the other side, so far as I
know, while we have with us all those writers who on the former ques-
tion hold that a disclosure does not prejudice evidence which has
been given.

We have not only the clear statements of Hartmannus and
Salycetus, ⁸but also of Panormitanus and F elynus, who write clearly
that the evidence of a person is not invalidated if he has stated in
advance in the presence of a party concerned what he was to say in
the trial. Indeed they maintain that it is a precaution to have him
brought in to make a statement in advance, so that 113 may not have
ground for changing his testimony. t This would be the noteworthy
philosophical argument of Bartolus, ⁰ and with reference to this
philosophical argument, we would observe here that, although it
