Of an Action for Possession to Cover the Retention of Property;
of Cancelinq a Sequestration; of a Iuratory Bond,
and of Acceptinq Certain Bondsmen

That ⁸ one who holds possession ought not to be disturbed in his
possession, both the doctors say, and it is undoubtedly the truth.
¹³ Likewise it is certain that disturbance results, when one cannot use
his possession freely, ⁰ for possession means the use of a thing. ειΙιι
like manner they say that use is interfered with by a sequestratim,
that hindrance and annoyance are caused to the possessor, that in
fact he is robbed in a way by sequestration; ⁰ that, therefore, custody
ought not to be granted, but that bondsmen are enough to safeguard
the property, which the judge will not bring under his control on the
pretext that there is danger of a very serious temptation, unless per-
chance proof be given of this danger. vaen the spreading abroad
of reports is disturbing in the opinion of everybody. Β In short, the
interdict, beginning Utrubi, which we have interposed against them,
is granted to prevent a judicial sequestration. ¹² lt ιε given against
one who causes a disturbance by judicial procedure; it is given against
one who causes a disturbance when he 1s not in possession.

NoW, our adversaries clearly do not have possession, they say
they have been robbed, ¹³ and therefore they do not have possession.
We have established our right to possession, ¹since it is enough to
have proved the right at the time when the suit was brought, or the
disturbance made. ¹¹² We did not have to furnish a regular proof either
that we do not hold possession by violence, in a secret way, or by
sufferance, ¹² and we are n'ot even forced to show title for our posses-
sion. ⁰ Indeed, in a doubtful case just and bona fide possession is
taken for granted. Ρ Good faith is taken for granted, at least when
a just title testing on purchase precedes. qGood faith is taken for
granted even when a stolen article has been bought, since it is taken
for granted that the wrong deed, the 'act of another, was unknown.
Therefore, since our right of possession and the disturbance caused
by our adversaries have been proved, what remains except‘ that our
adversaries should be told that they must cease annoying us both
now and in the future, and that they should be fined for the loss

caused to us by annoyance in the past?
