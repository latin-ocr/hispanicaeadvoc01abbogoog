1 24 Alberico Gentili

Or, even suppose that from our people came the offense and that
an unjust one. Should the surrender agreed on not have helped thern?
² You admit that they have not been captured who have surrendered
even from the direst necessity. Or, even suppose that they were cap·
tured. Pray‚ have persons and goods when captured become the
property of the captor? Of course, we are to some extent at war

122 with the Tuscans and this was a battle between enemies, which in
these circumstances would be judged in accordance with the public

laws of war, but they should not be held guilty of wrongdoing and
murder like pirates. ¹¹ On the other hand, the learned Alciatus and
the clearest principle of law both rule that neither the persons nor
the goods captured become the property of the ,captors. Not even
the goods, you ask? But they did not belong to those who fought.
Χ “ Now, the act of these sailors does not harm the owners,” :r since
the former are not understood to have committed wrong in accord-
ance with the instructions of the latter, and the latter seem to have
given their instructions simply after the manner of merchants. ² “ The
owners would not suffer harm, even if the sailors said that they acted
in accordance with instructions.” See how even with this liberality of
mine in making defense the sailors can scarcely be harmed—and the
owners not even as much as that. But indeed, since the sailors simply
defended themselves and that defense was on every count justified,
what conclusion can we reach except that the Tuscans should make
good to us ⁸⁸ as people who have been despoiled, everything that has
been taken away and the losses incurred, the expense, the interest, the
profitS, and so forth, to the last penny?
