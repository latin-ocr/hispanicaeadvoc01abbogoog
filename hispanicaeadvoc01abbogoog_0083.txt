Articles Sola in Brazil in Violaeion of the Law Are Souqht in
Enqland by the Spanish Fiscus

We maintain that what was sold by the Spaniards to the Dutch
in Brazil has become the property of the Spanish King‚ since confis-
cated property comes to the fiscuS, and this property has been con·
fiscated.

³C0nfiscated property is acquired by the fiscus at once, under
the law itself: ¹² “And this ruling carries execution with it, since
this is one of the special cases in which there is no need ‘of a suit,
because the penalty may be imposed when the property is found and
it has regard to the property only. Other penalties are regularly
imposed by way of action or suit and through a verdict and execu-
tion,” to quote the correct statement of Raphael Comensis. ² BartoluS,
and Alexander, τοο, state that, when the offense concerns property,
ownership “ undoubtedly ” falls to the fiscus without a verdict.
“When the law covers execution, then no other execution or act on
the part of a man is needed. ⁶ Ownership is vested in the fiscus at
once, and he who has acted contrary to the law ceases to be the
owner, asDuarenus also says in this connection. Indeed, it is certainly
the opinion of everybody. f So completely does this property cease to
belong to the former owner that he may now buy this very property,

’ 55 and no one buys his own property. ⁸ So completely does it become the

property of the fiscus that the fiscus may act in this case by merely

claiming the property. And why shouldn’t he, if he is the owner?
¹² For the simple reason that if a man has acquired the ownership of a

 

thing, he always acts in this way, as the titles of De rei vindicatione ² ’

shOW, and as the doctors teach in accordance with these titles. Why
is not the fiscus the owner, if the former owner has lost ownership?
¹Ownership cannot hang in the air. ¹² So true are both these facts that
the property has ceased to be his and that it belongs to the fiscus, that
a man may be held to the fiscus for the price of it if he loses it by
fault before it has been handed over to the fiscus. These conclusions
are sure. ¹And we feel perfect confidence in talking of the goods in
question as confiscated, if public declaration of their ownership has not
been made. But even if a thing has been sold contrary to the require·

mints of the law, [it is subject to confiscation], as Duarenus and
ot ers state.
