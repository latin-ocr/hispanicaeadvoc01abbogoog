and have not brought forward their reasonS. ‘¹ Bologninus is himself
an unworthy guide3 he has not a very keen mind, nor is he well
acquainted with principles, and this is the opinion which well-trained
writers express about him.

⁸ That no citation is required in this case even Pax-isius teaches,
as well as Decianus, Menochim, and all the writers on canon law.
All those who write that “ mere knowledge ‘’ is enough hold the same
view τοο, ‘as Castrensis and Panormitanus remark. Panormitanus
also speaks explicitly against the need of a proclamation. ⁸ So does
SocinuS, on the ground both of l. saepe,² and the said decretal.²
¹² Similarly on the ground of the same law, Cravetta and others say
that a legal action between certain people prejudices another who
knows of it and suffers it, even to the fullest extent. iLikewise
on the basis of the same law Tiraquellus says that he who has
the first right of action concerning any matter, or the right of de-
fense, and suffers the next in order to bring action, even if he has
not been summoned, is just as much prejudiced by a res iudicata as
if he had himself brought an action or made a defense—as if (I
will add this to the preceding clause) “the debtor should have al-
lowed the creditor ” to go to law concerning the ownership of a
pledge, etc. ¹‘ A man who is informed does not need to be informed;
knowledge takes the place of a warning3 where knowledge is enough,
it makes no difference whence it comes. ¹1³ urther‚ Angelus speaks
of the citation of a man who for other reasons had to be cited, but
not of the necessity of citation in the exceptional cases with which
we are now concerned, where knowledge only is required, and in this
way the very learned Hondedeus explains the passage in Angelus.
¹¹¹The younger Angelus asserts that this is the dictum of Perusinus,
when a verdict of itself harms. . well, enough on this point of cita-
tion‚ if this objection shall be urged against us by our adversaries,

¹¹ It is required also that he who goes to law be an opponent
with a legal standing, in order that the verdict may injure another,
and he is said to have a legal standing, whom the case, which affects
another indirectly, chiefly concerns, and undoubtedly the master of
the ship is not such a person. But there is more than one sense in
which one is called a defendant in legal standing. ⁰ Menochius (let
us note this point first), in harmony with Covarruvias‚ very properly
makes three distinct categories of the verdict which injures a third
party, one derived from the nature of the case itself, another from
knowledge of the suit, the third from an irregularity. Now, it is the
first category that has to do with this definition of a legal defendant,
so that, in consequence, outside of the said category a legal defendant
of such a sort is not required. Ρ Therefore‚ Menochius als0‚ in dis-
