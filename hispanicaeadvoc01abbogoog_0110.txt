The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 85

did not keep the watch that night.” ² rThey have not done what
everybody on board ship is wont to do, at least what all guards are
wont to do and ought to do, and especially, guards of such a sort as
ours are, who are stationed to prevent these very predatory raids that
threatened them. ⁸ But they are guilty of treachery who fail to do
what they are in duty bound to do, and what others have been
accustorned to do.

This rule holds whether they know or should know that they
ought to act. The law says: “⁴ There can be no excuse for a
shepherd, if a wolf has devoured his sheep, and the shepherd does
not know.” It sayS‚ ‘⁴ there can be no excuse,” ¹² and it calls atten-
tion to the unconditional obligation even in the absence of the ability
to meet it. It says», “ he does not know,'’ ¹ so that he is responsible,
since his ignorance of what should be known is thought of as pre-
tended, and, therefore, is regarded as knowledge. ”Negligence is
proved in various ways, for instance, when a man is held to the per-
formance of a certain act within a fixed time and locality, [negligence
is proved] by the very fact that this action has not been taken. Now,
we have to do with such an action. ² The negligence of the guards is
like treachery. ⁸⁸ The negligence of the vice-Admiral himself is es-
tablished, wh0, on going away, did not leave another person to keep
proper guard. bb We have proved treachery even in the case of the
man who does not do what he ought to do, the man who has not
applied the requisite remedies. Who would not criticize in this case
both the guards and the Vice-Admiral? ‘²⁰ He will not be excused,
even if he had shown the usual diligence in matters of this sort, for
in this case the proven robbers near at hand made the danger greater
than usual.
