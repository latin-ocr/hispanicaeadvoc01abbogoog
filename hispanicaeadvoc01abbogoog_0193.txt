made by a notary or by an agreement. wa, in this way I shall
reply to other arguments also, if they are brought forward—the
present arguments I am bringing up against myself on my own
account—to prove ownership, to prove possession.

These matters I note in order that it may be clear that these
adversaries of ours arc evidently bringing a false charge in daring to
offer a full and immediate proof of ownership and possession. And
they will not be helped by the common saying that things which do not
profit one, when taken singly, help, when they are many in number,
for if the points are many it is the rather probable that all of them
cannot be brought in at once. ¹³¹³ In this matter of proving ownership,
and to the aforementioned argument and to otherS, and to this com·
mon saying Menochius replies that in a case involving much money,
like this one of ours, several presumptions are not combined to make
a complete proof3 that in the case of presumptions or proofs which
taken individually do not tend to establish ownership, and the proofs
in our case do not tend to this effect, as he also shows, it is ,not
true that they may be combined to establish ownership. He also
says that this connection is never established when full and true
proofs are required, as full proofs are required in establishing own·
ership. ‘²0 In spite of the fact that Menochius elsewhere and others
teach that ownership is difficult to prove, and that therefore in prov-
ing it inferences and indications are accepted, this statement is not
to be applied to any inferences whatsoever, but to inferenccs which
establish a proof that is sure and approved by the law, and they
teach that it is to be applied only in certain caseS, such as those which
run back into the past. ‘³⁸³ So Decianus also distinguishes in this con·
nection between new and old matters. e¹²In addition I mention Cra·
vetta and Contardus, who teach that the proof of any ownership is
easy. ίϊΙ mention also Corneus who says that ownership is not so
difficult to prove, that proofs lacking in completeness should be ac·
cepted. There are more points to this effect, which have been set
down in writing‚ even in the very cases where merchants are con-
cerned, and in these cases they are said to hold. ⁸⁸ If proofs in these
cases are not dispensed with, proofs concerning the merits of the
case and concerning the deciding points are not dispensed with, ¹²¹¹ and
it is clear that there are proofs concerning deciding points. Now, I
do not inquire further. I know that not very many of the points
which have been brought forward by us in their behalf should be urged
against us by our adversaries. ³³1 deny that they have acquired
the ownership of the goods, even if bought with their own money,
even if bought under 'their instructions by their agent, unless also
in accordance with their instructions the goods have been handed
over to the agent, or unless he has handed thern over to the mer-
