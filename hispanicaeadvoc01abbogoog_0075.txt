CHAPTER XI
Of M oney Received from Pirates and of Their Partner

An enemy of the Spaniards who was on a piratical vessel belong-
ing to the BritonS, either as leader or soldier, received from the
pirates money, or property in some other form. The question arises
whether these go'odS, be they property or money, can be recovered
from this person by those who have been robbed.

Undoubtedly‚ if the person in question has received property
which is in existence, it is clear that he is called on to restore it. ¹² So
stands the law, and so hold the doctors in commenting upon it; for they
even condemn to this penalty the man who buys the property—the man
who buys it in good faith——and without allowing him to receive com-
pensation. So much the more will the law condemn the business part·
ner in a piratical enterprise. ὓ But if the aforesaid person who has
acquired property in good saith and has used it in good faith is still
held for the amount by which he has become richer, what shall we say
in the case of a pirate’s partner? ‘Furthen a man is considered
richer, even when a debt has been paid, ‘¹ and the man who says that he
has used up the property has t·o prove it, although he too would be
called richer, even if he had lost the goods by being cheated. But in
this case, we have not good faith on the part of him who knew that
he was receiving property from pirates,

But what I have said in the case of goods will also be true

48 in the case of money, if it is still in existence, for in this matter money
differs in no wise from other things, ⁸ as Menochius brilliantly states
it in his opinions. The same doctor says also that if oil, wheat,
money, or other things consumable with use have been consumed with
use by a money-lender or extorted in the form of interest, it is true
that the ownership of thern has been transferred, but still, although
the money-lender might not be solvent, an action for the restoration
of the interest would stand by way of relief. This is true in the case
of stolen goods and thieveS‚ because usury would be on a par with
theft, according to the opinion of the same writer.

N oW, concerning this matter I mention one thing more, which
may have great weight here. The law, he says, prevents deceit be·
ing practiced upon it, so far as it can. But if the transfer to another
of a loan bearing interest were allowed, deceit would be practiced on
the law, because it would be easy for the money-lender to transfer
