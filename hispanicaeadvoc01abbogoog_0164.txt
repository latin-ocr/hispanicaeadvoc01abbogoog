The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 139

Whether they ought to be is another question from the one before
υς, whether they can be, as F elynus in harmony with Baldus properly
notes by way of distinction. Now, the reason which Gaillius gave
is not well based, since the point which he proposes for discussion
concerns the avoidance of a loss, while the conclusion which he draws
has to do with seeking gain. Moreover, the law grants expenses
and compensation for lost labor; as the dictum runS, “let him give 136
expenses.” iIt does not forbid the further giving of money later
on, provided it has not preceded the agreement.

We say further that the corruption of a witness is lawful. ΙιΑ
witness may be led by a reward to testify to the truth, if he would
otherwise refuse, as, following Archidiaconus and Baldus, other
writers assert without hesitation. 1Archidiaconus speaks to this
effect: “Hugo says that it is lawful to make a gift in public to
secure a just verdict and true testimony. The laws which stand in
the way apply when it is doubtful with what purpose the gift is
made, according to Laurentius.‘’ ¹¹² Baldus says that this is by way
of precaution, not for purposes of corruption. Furthermore‚ Ripa
clearly observes that the reason for this ruling is that a witness who
refuses to testify is presumed to have been corrupted, ¹² as Panormi-
tanus says, and as Ripa adds, by a party—the one for whose
advantage it would be, as I add from a correct ⁰old formula.
Consequently, Ripa concludes, by corruption from the other side he
ean be induced to testify, Ρ since it is lawful to thwart fraud by fraud
and, therefore, would be so in a trial. Joining with Baldus, I would
say that what is a matter of precaution is not corruption. ‘¹ It is a case
of corruption and it is unlawful when a person, seeing that he is
attacked by perjured witnesseS, fights back in the same way, with
perjured witnesseS. ‘ I know the assertion is also made that a witness
receiving money, even though he testify to the truth‚ commits per·
jury. But this conclusion would apply to the witness himself, not
to the man who calls him, nor to the evidence, if principles which
have been accepted in the past are recognized now. It stands to the
credit too of the man who calls the witness that he has given the
money publicly. The fact that the transaction goes on in public
clearly removes the suspicion of evil intent, as Menochius has ex-
plained even in this case. When the intent with which the money is
given is doubtful, then the laws which forbid giving apply. The
demand of Felynus, in company with Hostiensis and Butrius, whom
he citeS, that the judge be informed in this matter of refunding expenses
or losses as a safeguard against evasion of the law, is justified only 137
when the transaction does not take place in public, and, therefore,
evasion is feared3 but when the transaction takes place in public the
suspicion of evasion disappears, and the remark of Felynus does
