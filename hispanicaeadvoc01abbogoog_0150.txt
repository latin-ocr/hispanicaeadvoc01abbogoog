CHAPTER XXVIII

Passaqe-Money Is Owed for the 'Turks Captured by the Tuscan
on an Enqlish Ship

The'Tuscans who captured their enemies, the Turks‚ and their
goods on the ship· shall pay in full to the Englishmen the fare which
the Turks would have paid to the English ship at the place agreed
upon; ⁸ for the victor takes the place of the vanquished‚ and any
and every possessor is bound by an hypothecary action, and for
passage-money everything is subject to a lien. bThe Tuscan is held
for the whole fare, no matter what may have happened with refer-
ence to the persons and property of the Turks, not as a result of the 123
situation of our men, but as a result of their own situation. ”The
claims upon property go with it when it changes hands. ‘¹ The victor
comes under the law that applied to the vanquished. Tell me, would
not the Tuscan be willing to accept a claim of the vanquished Turks,
if they had had any of a like kind on the goods of the Englishmen?
‘He would be quite willing, you may be sure. Accordingly, he
should be willing to accept the present state of affairs, when he would
have done so if the situation had been reversed. He should be pas·
sively willing now to accept what then he would have actively willed
to receive. ‘The rule is, according to nature, that a loss should
be felt where a gain was expected. This in brief in regard to the law.
Now, if, as the story goes, our countrymen actually had an agree·
ment to this effect with the Tuscans, so much the clearer and more
definite would the case for our countrymen be.

A sliqht addition for the end of Chapter XXVI.—Then, ton,
the great Duke, with that generosity of his which he promises our
countrymen unasked, will take into consideration the fact that our
men who were skilled in navigating the ship were taken from it and
others unskilled were put in charge of its navigation. I mean the
English ship which others not Englishmen lack the skill to navigate as
well as those who are accustomed to do so. Lack of skill is accounted
a fault, and if there is even a slight lack of such skill, the lessee too is
held responsible. This is certain. If I knew the rnen whom the
Tuscan put in charge I would say whether they are skilled; ⁸ for he is
skilled who has thrice acquitted himself creditably; he is thoroughly
experienced, a master, etc. One should consider the place where the
ship was lost, to see whether a skilled navigator would have lost her
