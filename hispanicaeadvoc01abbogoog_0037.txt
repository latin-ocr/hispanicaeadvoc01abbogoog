ert-y of the captor, th'at is, after the captor has willed to regard it
11 as having become his, ‘³⁶ as I have set forth elsewhere. Why should
it not be taken so? ff Whatever is proposed for the benefit of anyone,
carries the implied condition, “if it shall have pleased him.” This
condition holds also when anything is done by automatic action of

the law (ipso jure), as we say. ⁸⁸ A thing captured becomes the prop-
erty of the captor ‘⁴ at once,” that is, after it has been handed over to
the captor’s commander. On this point see Socinus, Socinus the

Younger, and others. ²¹²² RuinuS, too, who holds that movable things
become at once and automatically the property of those who take and

seize thedm‚]takes it for granted that they have been shown [to the
comman er .

fl Resides, these very particles of which we are speaking, precise
though they are, have their meaning qualified by other laws. But
of the law on this point, enough!

Property not yet brought to a place “ presumably ” safe does
not yet belong to the captors, nor has the ownership of it been lost.
One must make the same statement of the case when our soldiers
have followed the enemy without delay even within his fortified lines,
because in these circumstances we do not think that goods have be-
come the property of the captors, since the place is clearly unsafe.
But the spoils cannot have actually passed out of the sight of our
men, and so we do not regard things as captured which are straight-
way recovered. Thus Salycetus concludes and I follow him; kl‘and
so there should be no question of postliminium here where nothing
has been actually acquired by the enemy.
