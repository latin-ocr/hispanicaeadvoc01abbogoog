CHAPTER XXIII

Of an A qreement Made in Consequence of F ear and Guile

If anything is found to have been done, it is the presumption
that it was done voluntarily and not through fear, because otherwise
a delict would be presumed, for the reason that the person who
should use fear in accomplishing his purpose would be committing
a delict. ⁸ This is the view, and held without qualification, t'o0, which
Alciatus gives on other cases in dealing with the rules applying
to presumptionS. However, the more difficult proof does not fall,
as it may in other cases, upon him who wishes to prove the existence
of fear in spite of that presumption of the law3 for, as it is the gen-
eral custom to employ fear secretly, the easier and inferential proof
is enough, as we have it in the same writer and on other cases, Thus
τοο, guile, though not presumed, is proved by inference—¹‘ as others
also have explained at length—and by circumstantia] evidence. ⁰ Ex·
cessive precautions prove the existence of guile, and here the precau-
tions are of this kind. ‘¹ Guile is proved by frequent efforts to per-
suade one3 this likewise was the situation in the case of Pintus. To
persuade is more than to compel. Thus, therefore, the reply has been
made that the action was the result of guile, of a fraudulent scheme,
and that a person using fraud in the way described is held for darn·
ages.

θ Guile is presumed on the part of him who has acted through an
agent and has not taken care to see the contract. And the man who
had a transaction with Pintus did not take care to see under what
authority the latter might act. This is especially noticeable, since he
had heard too that Pintus did not have the authority to transact any
business whatsoever. Let them not cast up to me the clauses of this
transaction. ‘They all vanish into thin air, if guile is found3 ⁸ and 222
they vanish if.they are understood to have been drawn up with the
same intent with which Pintus was, induced to engage in the trans-

action.
