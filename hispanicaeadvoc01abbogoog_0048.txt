The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 23

by the owner of a field does not have to do with the security afforded by
the state, as a change of territory does. I too have answered this

· point in the chapter immediately preceding. ⁸ But what do we say

to the principle of law which I too have laid down elsewhere, that
anybody and everybody is bound to hand over to the victor the
property and the person of the vanquished? It is quite evident under
this principle that the territory of another ought not to be a place of
succor to the vanquished. But in the same passage my reply has
been that this doctrine may be affirmed in the case of a complete
victory, not in the case of a small success. And here it does not
follow that, if it is lawful for a victor to try to secure the spoiIS,
it may also be lawful per se for him to take them, or even that he who

rples a territory may always be required to turn them over to the
v1ctor.
