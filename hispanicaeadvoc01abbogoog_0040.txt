The Pleas of a Spanish Aci-vocate, Bk. I. 15

‘But with reference to this ruling of the soldiers, listen to
Angelus whose sels-same wordS, all of them, and this often happens,
are the words of Baldus on the point at issue: “ These troopers say
that booty is never said to have become theirs completely until after
it has been under their control for a night. For when they flee with
booty, it is not under their protection until they are in a safe place,
and they are speaking the truth. Consequently when they have been
led back within their fortified lines, even if a night has not elapsed,
still they have become owners of the booty.” In this way these
writers, out of the reasoning of the soldiers, bring the doctrine of
these soldiers into accordance with the meaning of the law.

Let us also bear the fact in mind that there are two different
questions: one, when we may regard captured goods as the prop-
erty of the enemy3 the other, when property recaptured from the
enemy need not be restored to the former owner. As Ayala writes,
the latter question has involved practically all the commentators in
many and manifold explanations, but the law in the first question
is quite clear, and therefore we shall not make a logical inference
from one question to the other.

A thing may be acquired by the enemy, and yet, if it be recov-
ered, may still be the property of the former owner, like property
which gains postliminium, ⁸ for such property acquired by the enemy,
and thus lost to the former owners reverte to them if it is recovered.
Why, were not our princes and soldiers who recover the property
retained both to protect our possessions and to support us? On the
other hand, the property may not have been acquired by the enemy
and yet when recovered, cannot be restored to the former owner, but
may pass to him who recovers it, naturally, in order that everybody
may be encouraged to fight, and that valor may get its reward.
Another reason for this principle is that the former owner may
not receive that, the reverse of which he would be unwilling to suffer
in the reverse circumstances, namely, the expenses and losses which
the other would have experienced in recovering his property—prop-
erty which he himself would not have recovered. ¹¹ These principles
others discuss in this connection, and I have stated them elsewhere.
So these two questions are different. iOthers also make the same dis·
tinction between thern.

And yet if you do not treat thern separately you may even reach
this conclusion that neither the decision of the soldiers nor any other
law or practice is at variance with the law, except perhaps in this
respect, that other practices call for some delay, and would not be
satisfied by the conveyance of goods within fortified lineS, as I have
said. Every case without exception calls for the conveyance within.
So too Joannes Andreae in dealing with the question of goods brought
