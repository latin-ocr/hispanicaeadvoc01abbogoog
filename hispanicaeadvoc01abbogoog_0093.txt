But Ι hear the parallel case cited of the King of France‚ who
sent Spaniards back to Spain not so long ago; he did not send them
to Ireland, whither they were sailing at the time, as enemies of the
English. I am not so sure that this is a parallel case. Indeed, if the
English committed no crime against the territory of France‚ then it

hours with a favorable wind, even against the will of the Dutch,
