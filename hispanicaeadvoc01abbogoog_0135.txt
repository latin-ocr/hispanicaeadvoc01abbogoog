1 10 'Alberz‘co Gentili

108 not to be cited rashly, and what applies to a state must not be extended
beyond the state absurdly. ¹³ Then let it be noted that it is valid to
argue from crimes to contracts, for they are put on the same plane
by the law. Therefore, if for a crime committed in one principality
account is not given in another, as Fulgosius explainS, then neither for
a contract made in one principality shall account be rendered in an·
other. Now, this argument is not weakened by the fact ‘¹that the
woman sentenced to work in the salt pitS, seized and taken from there
by brigands of a foreign nation and finally bought back by right of
trade, is said to resume her former status; nor yet by the fact that the
slave stolen by bandits, afterwards in the hands of the enemy, then
recaptured on their defeat and sold, is likewise said to revert to his
stolen condition so that the purchaser cannot acquire ownership by
usucaption. It is with reference to a state and its citizens that these
statements are made, but my merchants are not Venetian citizenS,
to whom, it is asserted, these things which have been bought back
belong3 these things were not bought back at Venice, in which case
they would have reverted to their stolen condition. Let me emphasize
the fact that it is not with a single state or its citizens that our ques-
tion has to do, and in addition let the reply be emphasized that our
present case does not deal with things which have postliminium and
revert to their [original] condition, for, as ‘even the freebooterS,
from whom our merchants made the purchase, would belong to a
foreign nation, the Turkish, so much the more would the goods have
belonged to the freebooters themselves, and here I do not mean
the fiscus.

Then as a third argument 1 add that what has been enacted
with reference to stolen property should not be extended to property
seized by violence. ³ You must admit that theft and plundering differ
in species, as all theologians and writers on our law agree. “There
are also differences of law between them. What is said regarding
thefts is not extended to property seized by pirateS, even though they
be the very worst kind of thieves; ² for Baldus maintains that what
is said against thieves should not hold in regard to plunderers on the

109 road, that is, to highwaymen, who are likewise most pernicious thieves.
Of course, in Baldus’ question the exception to the rule applied to
thieveS, an exception which he does not wish extended to plunderers,
because that which is not excepted would remain under the rule.
¹² Now, we have a very definite rule and one quite familiar in the law
of nations, to the effect that it is through purchase and delivery that
ownership is acquired, and that it ought not to be taken from us
without an act on our part3 and likewise that it is lawful to buy any·
thing and from anyone. ¹ “ Everything ” is understood to be “ duly ”
allowed which is not found to be ‘⁴ expressly ’⁹ forbidden. And “in
