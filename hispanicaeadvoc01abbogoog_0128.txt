The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 103

are aware that words are to be understood according to the usage of
the place.

The third argument is harmless, ‘because it would have to be
proved that each of the two foreign parties to the suit shared that
usage [sc. of having judges versed some in civil and some in com·
mon law] with each other and with Spain. That transactions or
judgments as between certain individuals do not prejudice other in·
dividuals is fairly shouted by the laws and sanctioned by the dic-
tates of reason. Then, ton, usage itself is strictly limited in nature.
It does not extend to other persons, to other cases, etc. For if any·
thing is done, ”it would not be done except so far as it is done;
the usage would not be such, except so far as it is in use. Granted
that these pettifoggers of the common law have pushed their way
into marriage cases, into testamentary, ecclesiastical and maritime
cases, and into others of this sort, which still have always been held
to be the peculiar province of those versed in the civil law, but granted 101

that they have pushed their way in, simply because those cases had
to do with Englishmen‚ with English concerns‚ with transactions car·

ried on in England; on this account, pray, shall they rush in and
scize these cases involving foreigners? Even though this state of
affairs is in part to be explained by the daily increasing power of
those who study the common laW‚ Μ’ still the old landmarks should
be preserved.
