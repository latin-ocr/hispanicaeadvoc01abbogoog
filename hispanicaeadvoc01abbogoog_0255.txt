which has just been given, and, therefore,—because this is another
source of the nullity—that it is null and void. ¹¹ “ The judge should
examine every phase of the question by making a full inquiry‚ by ques·
tioning the parties repeatedly as to whether they desire anything new
added, all of which the judge not only failed to do ”-1 use the words
of Cephalus-—“ but on being asked was not even willing to wait for a

’ moderate space of time,” as is clear from the last acts of our agent.

Perhaps there was no reason why he should hear us, who can
make some tellingstatements on the question of retaining the costs
of the trial, of dividing the costs with the losers, of the desirability of

not handing over those eight chests to the enemy, not to mention other ·

points, Againl Have these goods been taken from the Dutch by such
an expenditure of force, at such great expense, by such arduous toil‚
and shall all these same goods be restored to this same enemy with
such utter absence of effort?

The ambassador seeks to get justice against a subject of his King.
He opposes this exception to the execution of this worthless decision.
That decisionis of no value iwhich must be sent for execution neither
against the ambassador himself nor against another against whom it
was not given. Illustrious Lord, 1 ask you again to consider this
case: ·1f a Spaniard should wish to commit a delict against the laws
of his sovereign and the ambassador should request you not to allow
the subject to commit the delict, would you not have to listen to the
ambassador? Even should the subject not desire this, you at least

have no power to permit it. Will you not at least grant the ambassa-
dor time in which to warn that subject of his King not to hand over
these goods to the Dutchman? And this Dutchman, surely he has
no order to recover from the ambassador of his own King. Here,
t00, there is nullity owing to a defect in the order, and kthis nullity
will always be urged against my opponents.
