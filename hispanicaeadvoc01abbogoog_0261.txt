CHAPTER XXIX

Of the Sale of Thinqs Which {Ze Reckoned by W eiqht, N umber, and
casare

If those articles which are regularly sold by number, weight, or
measure are sold without specification, the condition is said to apper-
tain to the sale, “if they be counted, weighed, or measured,” ²as
the jurist clearly indicates by his distinction, that wine, for instance,
is either all sold in bulk, however much there may be, at a specified
price, and that in this case we should understand that the sale was
completed at once3 or that it is sold in such a way that there is a
fixed price for each jar, and that then the sale would be complete,
when the wine has been measured‚ ‘⁶ since the transaction seems to be
carried out on the implied condition that for each jar which shall
have been measured out‚” says the jurist in that connection, δ and the
Emperor makes the same point of distinction. ⁰ Baldus holds the same
principle with reference to the sale of land according to measurement,
namely, that the sale would be conditional in this way, ‘¹ and he says
that this point is proved, where he makes this observation. Leasing
and sale, in the case of either personal or real property, is conditioned
on measurement, that is, it depends on the measurement found, even
if fixed limits have been determined‚ eso that consequently before
measurement has been made the transaction would not be effected
under such a contract.

εΝονιτ, the following conclusion is considered correct by all
writers, namely, that if we begin with the maSS, and afterward men·
tion measurement, we should say that the sale was made of the
mass3 the reverse would be true, if we began with a reference to
measurement. It is said that in these circumstances the sale would be
conditional in the second case, even if the seller had given the buyer
liberty to use the purchase. The same distinction is made by
Oldradus and commonly approved, that if we begin with words in·
volving number or measurement, nothing more may be taken into
consideration than is indicated by the specified number. Otherwise
the added phrase covering measurement is by way of a misleading
indication.

Now one is said to begin with a number, if the limits within
which a certain body is contained are not expressly stated in advance,
for we cannot otherwise say that a mass has been determined. For
