The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate‚ Bk: II. 201

Now, our adversaries will make no objection because of the sum·
mary character of the procesS, for summary action has not been
taken in our case, as is clear from the proceedings. ·Still in our
case, as in other actions for possession, summary action ought to
have been taken, as all writers teach. They will take no exception
on the score of ownership, t for on this point exception is not taken
against this interdict‚ unless, and all writers hold this view in like
manner, they offer proof at once, which they can in no wise do. In
fact, even if they could do it, they would not be listened to, as the
more commonly accepted opinion goes, which is stated by several
writerS, and is approved by Menochius, who may be taken as the ,
equal of several writers in these discussions. “This opinion Cra·
vetta approves so heartily as to wonder even that there have been
people who could follow the opposite view; while Socinus the younger
holds this view so firmly that he does not accept undisputed owner·
ship as making an exception. Then what, pray, would follow if this
exception should be allowed? Still there is as yet no dictum about
it; so far is it from being recognized. ³ Even if the matter of owner·
ship were clear, if it were not disputed t00, a verdict on this question
cannot be given, ⁷ and in our case, when it is clear about the action
for possession at least, upon this subject announcement should have
been made first. ²Announcement must always be made upon an
action for possession, because one would wait almost in vain for
announcement about ownership. “And even supposing that we had
had a countersuit “ for recovery” brought against us (which was
not done, as it could have been), if th'e fact of our possession were
known in advance (as it was), pronouncement on it should have come
in advance; bb by clear proofs our adversaries would be bound to estab· 199
lish in this case the fact that they held possession, if one follows the
opinion of all writerS. ⁶0 All the principles of law in other cases
make it clear that the property should be released to the possessor.
’Μ Why should I mention the fact that the man who has been de·
prived of his property is reinstated only when he deals with the
robber? He is not reinstated in dealing with a possessor who
holds on bad saith, nor even in dealing with a later owner who holds
possession from the thief himself. ’θ The title Unde vi ² is not di·
rected against a single one of the later owners, and this point is clear.
ff The law si coloni ² is not a remedy against a later owner, who holds
a title and shows good saith. ⁸⁸ Ch. redinteqranda⁸ is not a rem·
edy against a single one of the later owners, as (so writers maintain)
the title Unde vi is not; it is not directed against one ¹who has a de·
fective claim to possession, nor against one who holds possession
from such a pei-som nor does it apply, for instance, even when the
