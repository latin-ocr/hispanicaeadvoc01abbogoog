The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 121

was such a fault on the part of the Tuscan's men who were placed
in charge, although unskilled, after the Englishmen, who were skilled
in navigating the ship, had been removed. ¹¹ Lack of skill is accounted
a fault. ⁰ Even he is held responsible for any mischance who may
have transferred merchandise into another ship equally su’itable,
against the will of the owner. Accordingly the Tuscan would be held 119
responsible for any accident to the ship, since he set others to navigate
it against the will of the owner. Succor should be lent to those acting
under constraint, and our countrymen would be regarded as acting
just as much under constraint in the accessory matter of hire, since
it was under constraint that they left the Tuscan their ship, ¹³ “ Hire
fromhim who can command brings the compulsion of necessity,'’ as
a great writer puts it.²
