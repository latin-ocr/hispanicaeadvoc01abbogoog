The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate‚ Bk. II. 237

instance, we begin with a number, ‘⁶ I sell you land to the extent of four
acres with such and such boundaries.” Thus the sale is defined by a
specified number in the same remark, “I sell land of so many acreS,
which are there‚'’ and, therefore, the excess is kept for the seller. In
these circumstances it does not prevent the sale from seeming to be 236
made according to measurement, because it has been made at a set
price, and, therefore, also for the article taken as a whole. The
argument drawn from the price [they say] applies to this contract,
⁸ but the fact that the price is a fixed amount is not indeed an argu-

ment on the other side.
Furthermore, objection does not lie in the fact that at the end

may stand the phrase, “ to have and to hold‚” etc.‚ a clause which
seems to have reference to a body taken as a unit, for the words of a
contract must harmonize‚ so that later statements may not modify
earlier ones. BesideS, this clause is not placed in the body of the
instrument, but in the administrative and supplementary sectionS,
which have less effect in making a change. Therefore, the saying,
“ the last clauses modify earlier ones‚” would not count in their sup-
port, and consequently it would not even be necessary to add the
clause, “ canceling‚” etc.‚ for that is understood even if the words
were exactly the opposite. ¹² Consult on all these points Decius,
where one reads that in a case of doubt we may understand that a
sale has been made according to measurement, since on this basis the
transaction would be less prejudicial to the parties concerned. Be-
sides, with this understanding reference to measurement should not
be superfluous· ⁴
Still‚ one must consider whether the fixed price corresponds more
to measurement or not; consult also Consilium 347 of DeciuS‚ where
one finds that which may be inferred from the character of the price
or of the payment as to what is sold or leased. Also in quoting
from Imola, he says that the number is always looked at when the
issue turns on a question not involving gain. Of course, in a matter
involving gain the common distinctions hold, viz., whether one began
with a number3 whether we are concerned with the same clause. Still
he holds the recognized distinctions in every case, and this procedure
is right. Now, he says that when in a sale or a lease the property
with its limits is described, and then a certain measure added, the sale
is not determined in accordance with that measure, but that, by indi-
cating a limit, everything is included which is within the limit. ² The
separate clause in this case serves as an indication, and yet an indica·
tion is not looked for. Take this case: “ I sell land with so many jars 237
[of wine] on it.'’ Here the number is for the sake of specifying the
limit fixed. “I sell land, and I say that there are so many jars there,
