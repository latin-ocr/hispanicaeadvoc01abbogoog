roa T ranslator’s Prefatory Remarks

means Digest, book 49, title 15, law 19, paragraph 3.² In Gentili
there are three headings regularly. Of these the main division stands
at the end of the citation, the subdivision next below it at the begin·
ning, and the smallest subdivision in the middle. Thus the reference
to the Digest just given appears in Gentili (I.ch.1.a)² in the form
I. 19. ἓ. 3. de capt. From the index which is prefixed to the texts of
Mommsen and Krueger de capt. can be identified as D. 49, 15 and
we at once have the complete citation D. 49, 15, 19, 3. Books 30, 3 1,
and 32 of the Digest are cited de leq. 1, de leq. 2, and de leq. 3
respectively, so that l. 41. ἓ. 2. de leq. 1 (I.ch.1.c) means D. 39, 41, 2.
Occasionally a law is cited not by its number, but by its‘first word.
Thus l. cotem. D. de publican. (Advocatio I.xx.b) Ξ D. 30, 4, 11.
In a few cases the Digest is cited by the symbol ff, as in the Advocatio
ILXVIIka where t. injuriarum. ἓ. Ι. ff. de injur. = D. 47, 10, 13, 1.
The part of a law which precedes the numbered paragraphs is re-
ferred to as principium, and the last law under a title as lex ultima.
Examples are seen in the Advocatio I.1.b where the citation is l. 5
princ. de capt. and in the Advocatio ΙΙ. xxv. l where the reference l.
ult. de re jud. is to D. 42, 1, 64. References to the Justinian Code
and to the other parts of the Civil Law are drawn up in a similar way.
For instance, (Advocatio Ι. v11. ll.) l. 6. C. de aedis. pri. = C. 8, 10,
6; (Advocatio I. XV. a) I. omnes. C. de quad. praes. = C. 7, 37, 23
(Advocatio Ι. ΧΧ. b) l. 2. 4. ult. C. de commer. = C. 4, 63, 2, 4,
and 6. The Novels in Gentili are called Anthenticae.

The Canon Law, it will be remembered, is represented by the
Decretum of Gratian and by the collections made since the twelfth
century. The Decretum Gratiani falls into three parts. Part I is
divided into 101 distinctioneS, which in turn are subdivided into

canones. Part Il is divided into 36 causae, subdivided into quae· ·

stiones. Part III is divided into 5 distinctiones, subdivided into

canorae-ge material which has been brought together since the twelfth

century consists of the following parts: Decretales D. Greqorii
Papae IX, divided into tituli, subdivided into capitula,· Liber Sextus

Decretalium D. Bonifacii Papae VIII, divided into tituli, subdivided .

into capitula; Clementis Papae V ConstitutioneS, divided into tituli,
subdivided into capitula, ·and finally the Extravaqantes, divided into
tituli, subdivided into capitula.

¹ For the benefit of the general reader, a more extended abbreviation has been given
in the translation for the main divisions of the Civil and Canon Law, as Dm. for Digest
and Decr. for Decretum. Otherwise reference is made as indicated above.

²This refers to bk„ chap„ and reference, and applies both to the Latin text and to
the English translation. The numbers in the outside margin of the translation indicate
where lnew pages begin in the Latin original. Pages vxvi are unnumbered in the
ortgtna .
