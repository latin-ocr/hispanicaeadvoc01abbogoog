tion, still it is enough that Bartolus, a jurisconsult of great authority,
thought this.'’ But I pass over these pointS. I say nothing in addition
about the authority of Alexander. I do not rest my argument espe-
cially on the fact ² that here and there Baldus and Butrius have held
the same view as BartoluS. I fight the battle in other ways.

'In the first place there would be the consideration that the
edict concerning witnesses is permissive. Therefore, to my mind, for a
like reason the edict concerning testimony would be permissive,
and what we do not find expressly forbidden and disapproved it is
right to do. But this matter about which our discussion centers has
not been prohibited‚ as my brother also confesses. 128

The second reason is that, since a witness (at least m civil suits)
may refer to what has been said before, even if what has been said
has no point—t this is the common opinion—therefore, a witness may
refer to what he has written, and this parallel Alexander, Mynsin·
gerus, and others draw. ¹³¹Even Panormitanus says that a witness
may refer to what has been said before, so as not to involve himself
through forgetfulness in the crime of perjury. This reason is valid
here too. Panormitanus also says that an appeal which the appellant
has reduced to writing and presents to a judge is valid, even if the
appellant should not read it, for he seems to satisfy the requirement
of reading it by basing his case upon it. The like situation here
may constitute the third argument.

The fourth argument is drawn from the ruling by the same
writer to the effect that notarieS, when bidden to announce a con-
tract, satisfy the order if they bring the documents and leave them
with the judge.

The fifth consideration is that the evidence of those who are
absent is not altogether rejected, xbut the authority of witnesses
who appear in person is said to have a certain value, and testimony
which we are in the habit of reading has a different value, so that
the authority of such testimony would certainly be worth something.
Besides, the question in this case does not even concern one who is
absent, but one who is present and presents his testimony in writing
to the judge after taking an oath.

The sixth argument is drawn from law 14, De dote praeleqata,²
itself in consequence of which Bartolus sets down there this opinion of
his, and in it we read of valid written testimony. It is valid in that case
without doubt if the judge had to reach a decision in accordance
with it. Panormitanus is utterly absurd in saying that the testimony
was valid there because it was not contradicted. Who revealed this
fact to him? How is that probable P Since, if the testimony had been
contradicted, it would not have been approved? Is this Panor-
