The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. II. 22 5

in perfect security. Why, he will exclaim, do we hear in this con-
nection so often that captured property comes under the ownership
of the captors “ at once‚” “ immediately,” if not even two months
would be enough? The doctors investigate and dispute regarding the
day in connection with the clauses dealing with this question. There·
fore, they are not likely to dispute about months, wa, their discus-
sion about fortified lines bears upon the question of the certainty that
the booty has been secured. Accordingly, where there is that cer-
tainty, there would be no need of the statement, “ within the fortified
lines.” These and other statements the judge will perhaps make.
But a reply has been made to these objections and will be made
[again], if they are repeated.

The judge will not say, eI know, that the facts regarding own-
ership have not been made known, that the trial was not one to estab-
lish ownership. Therefore, there will be no delay either in the
decision which would have to be given, even if the suit for possession
were left out, as our chief, Menochius, declares. fEven in a suit
for possession I shall reply that the possession was retained for our
clients by those of their number who were retained on board ship,
though against their will, by the enemy. But still the question of
unwillingness can also arise for us. Our clients surrendered and
their goods were surrendered, and, therefore, they too were ac·
quired by the enemy at the very moment when they were surrendered.
Β One who surrenders may not be slain at once, but it is not the case
with one who has been captured. Goods surrendered are acquired
at once, therefore, even though captured goods are not acquired at
once. Let us wait. We shall overcome this difficulty also.
