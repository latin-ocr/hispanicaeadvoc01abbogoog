The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 109

bene a Zenone,² hold good and that Ι arn contradicting myself, if I
argue otherwise. But there are differences between the present case
and that. ¹Note that the law mentioned provided that legal pro·
ceedings should be taken against the fiscus instead of the possessor.
Now, this principle does not hold in the case of the fiscus of Barbary,
which is an enemy to the Spaniards, as I pointed out there, but it will
hold in the case of the fiscus of Turkey, which has treaty relations
with the Venetians. Accordingly, the Venetians might and should take
action there, and, accordingly, they could not object that the matter
was now being handled outside the jurisdiction of the fiscus that made 107
the sale in this case, since it is still being handled just as it would
be there in the circumstances. There are other differences between
the present case and that other. There not only was the purchase
made of pirates, but the fiscus did not interpose except as a mere
matter of form, etc., and here Ι am urging, not so much the privileges
of the fiscus as I am the common legal principle of taking into account
the place of the contract. Therefore, let that argument stand here as
follows: Those who are safe in accordance with the law of the place
where the transaction occurred, are safe in England als03 but these
merchants are safe in accordance with the law of the place where the
transaction occurred3 therefore, they are safe here in England also.
Now let the second argument be: ¹²² The Atinian law, as also the
law which deals with the taint inhering in a thing stolen,² operates
between citizens and citizens; but the present action is not between
citizens and citizens; therefore, no statement shall now be made re·
garding the taint inhering in a thing stolen. That law was able to
bind these men also at the time when both Africa and Britain, not
Venice alone, belonged to the Roman state. But such is not the case
now that the states are separate and distinct. To illustrate, ¹¹ F ulgosius
replied to the same effect that the laW, directing that action in reference
to crimes be taken in the place where the accused persons are found, ,
had its sanction in the legal principle in accordance with which the
whole world was subject to the Roman Empire. But today, as shown
by the facts themselves and by that splendid interpreter of law that
should in no way suffer alteration, Ι mean custom, on account of the
separate jurisdictions or principalities, this is not s0, not even in the
relations of states which have mutual treatics. Not even in the relations
of states, Ι repeat, which have mutual treaties, as Baldus and Alexander
hold against Bartolus. Baldus says that Bartolus does not satisfy the
wise on this point, and that custom is against him, etc. But still, how-
ever the case may stand with regard to states which have treaties,
⁰ where Jason and others hold with Bartolus as to the law3 where states
have no treaties, the law is certainly as I have said. That civil law is
