view of their duty to do so ought to keep guard. This is true in
the case of any guard whomsoever. ¹ It is true too in the case of any
official whomsoever when a thing has been done in violation of the
duties of his office. ⁸The guard is also responsible for the slightest
error, that is, for the most perfect diligence in taking the necessary
precautions. The man who says that he has shown such diligence
must prove it, because it is not ordinarily found, ¹²ancl the fault
involved is not avoided without trouble. iFurthermore. all the laws
and commentators hold that public officials, even in their relations
with private citizens who have been injured, are held for the slightest
possible fault under the civil law and even for a mischance which fol-
lows a fault; that they are held for any negligence “whatsoever”
which injures a party, ¹‘that is, even for the slightest negligence.
¹Guards are held responsible for robbery3 they are held responsible
for an escape3 they are held responsible for a loss inflicted by others;
or they should prove that it is no fault of theirs.

Again, these guards of ours should show how they were driven
by the Dutch from their charge and from the possession of the ship
without any fault on their part. No battle is mentioned, and the
defense would have been very easy in that place where these very
Dutchmen had been made prisoners without any trouble a little while
before. Or if any violence has been offered, would not the Vice-
Admiral have punished the Dutch, as his duty, as the wrong done
his men, as the wrong done to himself required? ’ He is not excus-
able if he says that he could not punish them, provided he could have
got enough aid from the neighboring town, the town from which the
Dutch had been taken before, or from some other place in the
vicinity. ²²¹ These principles are laid down by those who comment on
the power of officials. Likewise they state that merely by means of
the letters of officials which must be accepted and obeyed, an official
may get help. Well, has he never been able to accuse those who
broke the peace? nHe who has failed to take action against a
manifest crime, is not free from the suspicion of secret complicity.
⁰ The man who fails to punish is a partner in crime or an instigator
of it. You would talk nonsense if you should say that the Vice-
Admiral has not heard from his own men or from others of this
act of violence. By presupposing such silence you would put his men
in the attitude of open treachery, pand indeed, guards themselves
sometimes steal, wherefore the satire sayS‚ “who shall guard the
guards themselves? ’' ² ‘¹ Then their negligence, as well as their treach-
ery, might have injured the owner. Therefore, if the Dutch did not
board the ship by an open display of force, but crept on board secretly
at night, there was great negligence on the part of the guards, ‘⁶ who
