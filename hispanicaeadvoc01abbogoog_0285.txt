would not even be called a legal fiction, mmmm for it is not indeed a
fiction, ‘¹⁰⁰¹‘ and even a legal fiction itself is the truth. ⁰⁰⁰⁰ The election
was opposed, or rather the objection was made to the candidate of
Menochius that he suffered from a certain deformity, on account of
which under the Levitical law he could not have been chosen to the
ministry of the altar, which Menochius’ client desired. Menochius
says that today such regard is not paid to deformity. We hold the
same view that such great attention is not paid to periods of time
today, when in the first place there are very many bachelorS, and when

reaching the period of life during which the statute provides that can-
didates are to be questioned on grammatical matters only. It is a
severe statute if it allows one to be admitted as a scholar of this Col·
lege ⁰⁰⁰⁹ only in case he can now be created a doctor under the common
law, and thus be in the College of Doctors; a man who can perform

other duties in the commonwealth itself. But neither ought severity
to be taken for granted nor severity in a statute, ‘¹⁰⁰⁰ for severity is
exacting justice, harsh, the greatest injustice, the greatest torture, etc.

Besides, has the statute thus far been interpreted in any other
way than Ι say it ought to be interpreted? Let a case be shown of
the formal rejection of anyone on the ground that he has not exceeded
the seventeenth year, provided he was in the seventeenth year. It
will be easier to point out individuals who have been admitted at an
earlier age. Let an investigation be made. Ι pass over what is very
often mentioned here, i.e., “ff that it has been wont to occur very
often at Toulouse and Avignon that an election to a college is an-
nounced owing to a bribe, in which case the statutes are violated, and
the great crime of simony is committed. But the statutes are observed
most scrupulously, most strictly, to the very dotting of the i’s and the
crossing of the t’s, when places are to be allotted for nothing. And
shall nothing be granted as a favor to the father who makes the re-
quest, a father who has in no wise deserved ill of the Academy?
And as a favor to the King who, for a second time, and with a
greater right to be heard, requests to have the boy accepted, shall
not this concession be freely made? And will they not listen to justice
which Ι have shown to be clearly for the boyi’ ⁵⁸⁵⁵ A just interpreta-
tion prevails even over an exact meaning. Ι have set forth the just
interpretation, that in our case the year begun should be accepted
in place of the completed year, if that is just which is in accordance
with the law, and this is the interpretation of the laW. Μ Further·
more, not only the authority of the law gives words their true and
exact meaning, but this meaning should be taken on the warrant of
him who fixes the law, that such and such a word should be under-
stood thus in such and such caseS.
