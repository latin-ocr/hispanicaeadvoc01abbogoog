The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. Ῑ. 45

The sixth argument with reference to a justifiable defense, drawn
from our books on war, presents no difficulty, because the present
case does not fall into that class. These Britons are not making
ready to commit an offense, but they are setting out to go to the
Spaniard to see if he will receive them and make use of their services.
So they are in this same conditional future.

The last argument does not present a difficulty, for it is based
rather on usage than on law, as Clarus himself recognizes at the
end. ¹¹ Baldus, τοο, in discussing those decrees—that is, the inter·
diets-—spoke of the practice of punishing transgressors on the way.
But the practice ought not to be extended. Besides, such a case has
a perfect justification, while ours has a conditional justification‚ as I 44
have shown. This reply should be noted in opposition to all the ar-
guments which could be urged on this point; for it is clear that the
Spaniard is not yet using those Britons‚ and he may not set them
down on his roll. How often have we seen men disappointed ΨΜ al
passure della banca (“ in passing muster ”), as we Italians say.
...And here I add what is accepted in the case of the licentiate, that
he does not rank as a doctor, because it is not absolutely certain that
he will be a doctor, for he must still be examined and passed, and he

may be rejected.

My conclusion is that unquestionably they cannot be put to
death, that unquestionably they can be brought back, that perhaps
they can be punished in some other, milder way. This last point
Baldus supportS‚ that he who takes the first step is not without sin,
⁰⁰ and this view Salycetus also holds, that the beginning too is for-
bidden, if the end is forbidden.
