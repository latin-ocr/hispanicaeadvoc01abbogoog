implied, “if it shall have been tasted.'’ 1’One would scarcely buy
otherwise, when it is observed that this condition, even when not
expressed, is an antecedent condition. ‘¹ Indeed‚ all writers hold this
view, rwhatever may be said at length on the other side by Azo.
⁸ Likewise a sale is called conditional which is made for a just price,
on the ground that the price ought to be paid in advance. Now,
Cephalus also in our first question about measurement says t that a
contract would not be conditional, but would be unconditional and
complete, so far as its substance goes, if the land is sold or leased on
the basis of such and such a price for each acre, ¹¹ but it would be con-
ditional if merely the price were stated, and the contract would be
complete, when the truth was noted, just as when a contract is made
on a condition relating to the past. It would be a conditional con·
240 tract if so many acres are sold or leased from the field. But it would
be conditional only as to the danger of destruction, because, if a
thing is lost before it is measured‚ the seller suffers the loss, but in
other respects the sale would be both complete and unconditional.
*These principles Castrensis and others hold, and they occur else-
where, Ἰ as one see‘s in Cephalus. Thus one ought to notice the way in
which the language is framed, ² for what is mentioned first is thought

to show more the purpose in mind. He has a discussion there which
shows more fully the conclusion that clearly, when the above rnen-
tioned distinction depends upon inferenceS, it follows that one rnay
be led by the more convincing inferences to see that the distinction
should not be observed‚ and that, although the mass may be men-
tioned first, still we may understand that the sale is made by measure·
ment.

He says too that inferences of this kind are noted by Jason
in a brilliant discussion in the above-mentioned opinion; that others
are noted by Torniellus, to whose opinion Declanus then subscribed‚
and Castrensis himself in like manner sets down other inferences.
The first case is when a place is named at the outset, and still a
definite place is not specified; then measurement is mentioned, and
afterwards the place spoken of is described. The second case is
when in mentioning measurement the contracting parties have shown
the greatest care, by indicating even the smallest part. Undoubtedly
from this precise care and from the designation even of a very small
part, it may be argued that the contracting parties have put their
main reliance on measurement, at least in his opinion.²
