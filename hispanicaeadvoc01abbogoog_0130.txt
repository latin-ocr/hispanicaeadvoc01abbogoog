The Pleas os a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 1·0 ς

an exceptio and retentio should likewise be denied thern, for these
two processes are more readily granted.

The fact should not be urged against our argument that the
law sp'eaks of pirates of a foreign nation3 that this case concerns
Englishmen who have redeemed from English pirates property taken
from the Venetians; that therefore the English have not obtained
the property from a foreign source,² ¹¹ and that even Englishmen
would not be foreign, so far as Venetians are concerned.

Now, Ι will reply that the jurist has happened to use this word

‘⁴ foreign,” which he employs, because of a particular situation, as '

comes out clearly from the written account of the case and from the
fact that a man’s proper name is used there. ¹Consequently, this in·
terpretation ought not to be restricted to the particular case. Be·
sideS, the theory of the doctors is to the general effect that prop·
erty in the situation mentioned is not recoverable, and it leads to a
general conclusion, even with regard to the non-foreign, and their
theory makes it clear that they have made their statements in a
general way, and not with a restricted application to the case men·
tioned in the law. Furthermore‚ the reasoning which safeguards the
interests of the owner, appendcd by the glossator to the law, is with·
out doubt of general application, and also concerns our case, because
otherwise recovery would not be easy. This reasoning is a deciding
factor in the present case before us, as the judge ”with whom the
decision rests in this matter clearly seeS. Then comes the point
which Ancharanus raises and interprets in the case of non-foreign
freebooters, as we have already stated. But come, let us examine this
very matter of a foreign nation. Undoubtedly the law says: ¹¹ “ Ι have
no doubt that independent allies are foreign to us.’' But Budaeus,
against the authority of the texts, as he confesses, reads, “would
not be foreigners,” to make the sense consistent, because the right of
postliminium does not exist with allies‚ but does with foreigners.
⁰ Furthermore‚ the famous old grammarians teach that a foreigner
is one whom we speak of as belonging to a foreign nation, to an alien
land, as coming from another people, 1’ and in Virgil we read: “If
you seek a son-in·law from a people foreign to the Latins . . . Ι
think that every land which is free and not beneath our sceptre is
foreign.” ‘⁸ In Cicer0, ton, in the case of the allies who were in a
Roman province we find the expression “foreign tribes.” ‘Those
who are not subjects are foreignerS, as one reads elsewhere in the
law. 'There are, in general, two kinds of peopleS, says Bartolus:

‘² [For the sake of bringing out the distinctions which Gentili makes in the fol-
lowmg argument somewhat arbitrary meanings have been given to the words exterus,
externus, and extraneus. The first two words have been rendered by “ foreign ” or
“foreigners” and the third by “ strange '’ or “strangers,” as being—although not
entirely satisfactory—at least more intelligible to the average reader than the almost
obsolete legal terms “exterus’' and “extranes.”]
