1 60 A lberico Gentili

there is presumption of bad faith, the third party will not hinder the
execution, as the common opinion goes, even if proof be offered at
once, as Felynus teacheS, in following others. 0In support of the
same conclusion I add Alexander, Jason, Cravetta; and in the latter’s
writings another authority is named to the same effect. Nor does
Decius in his responses take the side of Panormitanus, who teaches the
contrary doctrine in the supplement added to his treatise. ¹³ Decius,
in view of the reasons advanced for hesitating and for not settling the
matter, holds to the earlier opinion of Panormitanus which supports

156 the other side. He does not, however, reply on the decisive point,
since, without refuting PanormitanuS, he had another sure reply to
make, because in his case proof could not have been given at once.
‘¹ In his lectures Decius stands vigorously for PanormitanuS, and yet
he urges no argument in support of Panormitanus.

He does not even reply to the first, most convincing argument of
Alexander, the only argument which F elynus sets down, and which
Jason asserts is a good one. It is this: When pro‘of is required at
once, the offering of it accomplishes nothing further: but proof is
required at once to delay an execution; therefore, the offering of it
will not also eliminate the presumption of bad faith. I am sur-
prised that Covarruvias, who also inclines to the view of Panormi·
tanus, says that Decius has replied to Alexander. Decius replieS,
or tries to reply, to the other reasons of Alexander, but to the reason
given above he does not even breathe a word.

The reason given above is also confirmed in this case of posses·
sion of ourS, ³ in which, as involving an execution, proofs offered at
once are especially required to delay the execution. ‘To delay an
execution proof is required at once, but in particular to delay an
execution in a case of possession. Now, two argumentS, like chains,
hold them fast. Will the offering of proof even yet remove these
two and remove besides the presumption of bad faith?

The point which Decius urges about another argument of Alex-
ander which he turns against its author is also groundless, for it does
not follow, if the case of the robber would be a special one, because
the hatred felt for him prevents us from listening even to what he
wishes to prove at once —it does not follow that the procedure would
be the reverse in the case of one acting in bad saith. Indeed‚ Alex·
ander says properly that if this is true of the robber it ought to be
true also of one who acts in bad faith, for each of them is thoroughly
detested. Still I do not set about examining this point more thor·

157 oughly. It is enough that Decius brings nothing in support of the
opinion of Panormitanus, and nothing against the very strong argu-
ment of Alexander. I am surprised that Covarruvias also cites In·
nocent tin support of Panormitanus, and yet that in his entire dis-
