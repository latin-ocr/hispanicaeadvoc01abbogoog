1 8 A Iberico Gentili

ture. fAnd latent power can have the same effect as actual perform-
ance. But I have also replied to Cephalus in the aforesaid books and
I have refuted this view of his, Ι think.

At this point I add that the question about pirates raised by
Cephalus ought to be considered different from our question about
legal enemies. The practice, τοο, in the case of wounded wild beasts,
a practice contrary to law, ought not to be extended to enemies, wh0,
let us suppose, have beached their ships on the shore of Corsica,
as these pirates did. To pirates and wild beasts no territory offers
safety. ⁸ Pirates are the enemies of all men and are attacked by all
men with impunity, etc. Similarly the hunting of wild beasts is unre-
stricted. Therefore, in the case of the pirates, we may sa'y that they
could not have escaped, since they are always subject to capture
everywhere. But the same statement may not be made of enemies
who are not everywhere subject to capture, [for instance‚] not with
a common friend. The Spaniards are not subject to capture by the
Dutch here in Great Britain, in F rance, in any other part of Christen·
dom. Consequently the SpaniardS, even if captured, could escape in
many ways. ¹¹ Could captives be captured? iBut when the law
says that a wild beast, whether wounded by us, or a captive escaping

16 from our custody, but stillwithin our view and not hard to follow
up, has not recovered his natural liberty, it does not, therefore, also
say that it remains the property of the man who captured it. But
even if the creature did still belong to the huntei·‚ provided it was
on the point of being taken without difficulty, it does not follow that
a creature on the point of being taken without difficulty is the same
ashone taken. Undoubtedly it is always easier to keep a thing than
to get it.

Then this question of difficult pursuit must be examined in the
light of many a different hypothesis, but the examination will not
be furthered by supposing, as a certain solicitor absurdly pro·
posed to me, the recaptured Spanish ship put back in the place where
it was captured. Why, even in the case of a wild beast this practice
is not followed. kNor is it followed in the case where another
law says that Ι have not lost possession as soon as another person,
whom Ι will easily drive out, has entered my field with the intention
of taking possession. Does not the laW, taking into consideration
the ease of ‘expulsiom order judgment given in accordance with the
escorting into the field, even in the present circumstances?

¹ Hotomannus calls barbaric, though borrowed from the custorns
of the Romans, the similar practice which the Germans applied in the
case of claims, while the Romans symbolized it by the power of the
rod of manumission and the joint laying on of handS.

I cite another law: ¹¹² “ A boar falls into a snare which you had
