W hether the Purchasers of Plunder May Keep It for Themselves

The English merchants would refuse on any condition to restore
to the former owners the captured property they have bought. Ob-
serve that they bought it at TuniS, and in Tunis it is not the
law that buying even from pirates themselves is forbidden. But
nOW, if the law or custom of Tunis, whichever you call it, did give
judgment in keeping with the desire of these merchants, who can doubt
that here too the same judgment would have to be given? ⁸ In con-
sidering the details and merits of a case, according to the common
and universal view, the place where the transaction occurred is al·
ways taken into consideration. But these merchants bought from
the highest Tunisian officer, who had, moreover, the administration
of the main fiscus. Accordingly at Tunis they would have been safe,
and accordingly they would be safe everywhere. '³ He is at once safe
who buys from the fiscus of any perince whatsoever, according to
the more commonly accepted view, or, whatever the law may be,
it is certain that this ιε the actual practice, and such actual practice is
regarded as law. Nor do princes suffer their authority to be ques·
tioned. ‘¹1 do not dare, says Baldus 1n this connection, to assume a
lordly air and speak against the power of princes. Ι am not the
man to desire, says he,“ to re·spade” the world. Now, too, some

, Englishman may say to me: ‘⁸ If the merchants had bought these

wares in the open market of England‚ would they have had to make
restitution to the owners, whether they were Venetians or English·
rnen or others'st' ‘The law of England‚ as Ι hear lt, says no. Why
do Ι say the law of England? Elsewhere, t00, I doubt not, the law is
to this effect. ¹ It 1s at Padua.What1 do we say with certain men that
the law is not valid?

Fools though we be, we know ⁸ that actual practice, even though
not established m law, is regarded exactly like law. ¹² The ‘custom of
a place makes lawful the contract which would otherwise be unlawful.

¹That sort of contract is legal which 1s frequently used m a district
by good rnen and lawful merchants. Why then, pray, shall they
restore these wares bought from the Turkish fiscus?

[My opponents] will say ¹‘that Ι said m another case with ref·
erence to the fiscus of the King of Barbary, that only where the fiscus

of one’ s own prince is involved does that legal principle, the law
