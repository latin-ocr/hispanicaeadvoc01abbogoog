namely, the English civil law. Now, in this review of the cases ap-
pealed, Ι do not see, and no one else, Ι fancy, can see, what the pro·
fessors of the other kind of law could review. What if that other
kind of law should contain enactments contrary to those of the civil
law? ‘¹ The view of a distinguished man that a ruling given in har-
mony with the school of the interpreter should not be criticized,
always holds good. Therefore, if the ruling of the judge of the Ad·
miralty is given in accordance with the law he professes, that is
enough. Now this is my first argument. The judges who hear the
appeal should be of the same class as the first judge. But the first
judge is a professor of English civil law. Therefore‚ the judges who
hear the appeal should be professors of the English civil law. θ The
judge who hears the appeal should preserve what the original judge

let the judge in the appeal review the case. Should not the judge
simply pronounce the earlier decision as unjust or just? Accordingly,
the case is just the same in the second instance as it was in the first.
Why should Ι quote that platitude to the effect that the substitute
should be of the same character as the man whose place he takes?
For the appellate judge is a sort of substitute. ⁸ The setting in which
a judgment has begun should determine that in which it should end,
and this is the more creditable course to follow, and a course in har-
mony with the law3 therefore [it should end] under the law under
which it has begun. But if the contrary usage is urged against all these
considerations, a reply will presently be given to this objection.
Meanwhile the second argument will be that every passage
which could lead to different decisions on the same case should always -
be blocked. ¹² From this comes our popular maxim that the continuity
of cases should not be brokem and that one part of a case should
not be heard before one judge‚ and another part before another.-
Then‚ too, the consideration is urged that different decisions should
not be given in one and the same case. ¹ And so all laws always take
care that the judges be even constrained to render the same decision.
¹¹ Thus an odd number of judges is chosen that one decision may always
prevail. In the same way there are numerous other points of the
same kind. But pray‚ who can doubt that those versed in the com·
mon law and those versed in the civil law will disagree? ¹“ Man·
kind’s proneness to disagreement is natural.” ¹¹²Those jurists have
long entertained feelings of open and inveterate hostility for one
another. Even the laws of which we are speaking disagree; yeS, they
do, Either the laws disagree or else the expounders of the laws
disagreed in that case which the illustrious Emperor recently decided
in harmony with our contentiori, for according to the pettifoggers
